Amazon Scraper based on Python

I took the original idea from Dev Ed, check his explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY

I added the posibility to check numerous items at once, and pretend to add more features in the near future (check the todo.txt)

Also, notice how there are some sentences in spanish, that's because I'm spanish. Change the sentences to your native language or your personal preferences. Maybe I will include something to make it easier in the future.

Thanks to Dev Ed for the idea, last time I tried to do it ended up creating a near 200 lines script with a lot of errors...
Hope this helps you in your consumist urges, have fun.
